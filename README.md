Reproducible Data Analysis Project 10157
This repository contains data from the 2018/19 NBA season and the process of creating a multiple linear regression model to attempt to predict points. This model has then been used to evaluate players in the league and recommended the best players that should be targeted at each position for the Chicago Bulls in the upcoming season (2019/20).
